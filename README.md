# Marine_Hud
This is a Conky script that has the look and feel of a Marine Hud in my humb opinion hehe  I tweaked and tweaked til I got this look and feel and Functionality
Start by creating a `~/.cronky`  Directory if you do not have one.
then create a directory called `~/.cronky/Marine_Hud` 
`cd ~/cronky/Marine_Hud` and run git clone. and lastly  `mv * ../`
Then run `conky -c ~/.conky/Marine_Hud/conkyrc_Marine_Hud`

## Troubleshooting:
You need to Tweak the network Section to your network interface based upon `ifconfig -a`

any where you see wlp5s0 replace it with the network interface on your machine.

Feel free to leave and questions or report any issues in the git issues tab

thanks
